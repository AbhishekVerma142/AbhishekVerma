Hey there 👋
I am Abhishek (he/him), a Data Engineer, a writer, and a yoga enthusiast from Florida. I've worked in tech for 7 years, and I've been a google professional data engineer for the past 4 years, mainly focusing on creating/setting data pipelines from scratch.

I share what I learn while building software on my website.

My daily contributions
As an Individual Contributor, my daily contributions revolve around:

designing and implementing features with robustness and implications in mind,
code architecture, codebase consolidation, untangling legacy code, and increasing code coverage,
shipping APIs used by millions of users,
interacting with databases,
troubleshooting,
mentoring junior developers,
documenting practices and processes,
laughing way too loud during meetings (please adjust your headphones levels 🙏)
